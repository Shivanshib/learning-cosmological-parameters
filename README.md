This is my code for my UCL Practial Machine Learning for Physicists final project. 

This project uses data described in:
Villaescusa-Navarro et al., “The CAMELS Multifield Dataset…”, arXiv:2109.10915.

The data needed to run this can be found here: https://camels-multifield-dataset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
